		<p>Archival records comply with ISAD(G) specifications and include a subset of 40 fields. The level of description is currently limited to Fonds.</p>
		<p>Records include 4 Sections, namely: Keeper, Creator, Collection, Subjects (art historical data). The latter is meant to provide detailed insights on the scope of collections, such as:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Periodization (centuries, periods, styles)</li>
			<li>Genres and themes</li>
			<li>Artists and artistic schools</li>
			<li>Relevant persons (scholars, patrons, collectorsâ€¦)</li>
			<li>Artworks</li>
		</ul>
		<p>An agile cataloguing process supported by Semantic Web technologies and Linked Open Data sources allows to produce high quality data.</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>REUSE</strong> terms belonging to selected data sources (suggested while filling the form) facilitate data reconciliation and data consistency across systems. Reused sources include <a href="https://www.wikidata.org">Wikidata</a>, <a href="https://openlibrary.org/">Open Library</a> (Internet Archive), <a href="http://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/ulan/">Getty ULAN</a>, and <a href="http://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/aat/">Getty Art and Architecture Thesaurus</a>. Only missing terms in existing sources are here given of a bespoke identifier.</li>
			<li><strong>ENHANCEMENT</strong> long free text descriptions are parsed by means of two concurrent NLP tools (namely <a href="https://www.dbpedia-spotlight.org/api">DBpedia spotlight API</a> and <a href="https://github.com/spencermountain/compromise">compromise.js</a>) so as to suggest archivists resources (e.g. people, subject) that are immediately reconciled to Wikidata.</li>
			<li><strong>ACCURACY</strong> cataloguers can accept/reject automatic suggestions while filling the form, so as to ensure curated data are produced.</li>
			<li><strong>COLLABORATIVE</strong> cataloguers part of the editorial board can access all records, including the ones created by other institutions, make changes, and add new information.</li>
			<li><strong>CONSISTENCY</strong> members of the ARTchives editorial board review records for data cleansing purposes and consistency-checks before publishing.</li>
			<li><strong>VISIBILITY</strong> a subset of data created by cataloguers is accurately annotated and published on Wikidata so as to foster its reuse in a broader context than ARTchives.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Be aware that cataloguers are meant to describe <u>only collections that are owned or preserved by the institutions they work for</u>. Whether a cataloguer is willing to record the existence of a collection owned by another institution, s/he is strongly encouraged to follow the following instructions:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>add detailed information about the keeper (if not already available in other records);</li>
			<li>add all the available information on the historian (if not already available in other records);</li>
			<li>include <u>only</u> an attributed name to the collection.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The editorial board will contact responsibles of the institution and will ask for the permission to publish information on the collection at hand.</p>
		<p><i class="fas fa-exclamation-circle"></i> Do not confuse archival collections with nuclei of documents. While the first type requires a cataloguer to create a bespoke record, nuclei, i.e. documents that are part of miscellaneous collections, can be annotated in the optional field <em>Notes</em> related to the collection.</p>

		<h3 class="articleSubtitle">Guidelines for creating new records</h3>
		
		<h4>Before you start...</h4>
		<p>Users and institutions that want to contribute must request an account (see the <a href="contribute">contribute page</a>) to access ARTchives backend.</p>
		<p>The ARTchives web application is tested to work properly on Chrome and Safari (latest versions are highly recommended). <em style="color: red;">Internet Explorer and older browsers are discouraged</em>.</p>
		<p>A number of fields offer autocomplete suggestions when typing. Terms are retrieved on-the-fly from external data sources. Therefore, having a good WIFI connection is highly recommended. </p>
		
		<h4>Tips: Autocompletion</h4>
		<p>Fields with autocomplete functionalities are identified by a plaholder in the text area, which shows what data source is going to be used. </p> 
		<p>A dropdown pops up while typing, including best candidate matches.</p>
		<img src="./static/imgs/autocomplete.png" alt="screenshot entry form autocomplete"/>
		<img src="./static/imgs/orangeList.png" alt="screenshot entry form autocomplete"/>
		
		<p><i class="fas fa-exclamation-circle"></i> <em>Suggestions are retrieved on-the-fly. The search starts on keyup (after few milliseconds) and can take few seconds if the connection is unstable (so be patient!). Secondly, results may reload slowly, meaning that refinements of the search might take time. If no relevant results are found at the first attempt, please try to remove the last character and re-type it. Lastly, when looking for two or more words (e.g. people names, place names, types of objects) be aware that you may have to try several combinations of words (e.g. <code>firstname+lastname</code> rather than <code>lastname+firstname</code>)</em>.</p>

		<p>In dropdowns will appear blue items, which are terms belonging to the external data sources, and orange items, which are terms created by other users in ARTchives in prior records. The latter appear <em>only if no results in external sources are found</em>. Blue links include: an external link redirecting to the definition of the term (click on the icon), the label of the term (mainly in english) and a brief descripton for disambiguation purposes.</p>
		<p>If a match is found, the user clicks on the blue underlined item in the list and a blue tag appears below the text line in the form of a coloured button (see image below).</p>
		<img src="./static/imgs/tag.png" alt="tag selected from the dropdown"/>
		<p>Otherwise, if no significative matches are found, the user can type the desired word/sentence and press enter to create a new tag. This will appear as an orange button below the text area.</p>
		<img src="./static/imgs/newtag.png" alt="tag created by user"/>
		<p><i class="fas fa-exclamation-circle"></i> <em>Terms created by users will be available to other users too when creating new records. Be aware that this choice is suggested only if no existing terms are available.</em></p>
		<p>Colors respect the same principle above described. To remove wrong tags simply click on them.</p>
		<p><strong>Fields without autocomplete functionalities</strong> do not show any placeholder, and no tags will appear after the text area (see image below).</p>
		<img src="./static/imgs/noautocomplete.png" alt="screenshot entry form without autocomplete"/>

		<h4>Editorial Standards</h4>	
		<p>For each field in the entry form there are examples on how to fill the field at hand (see the icon <i class="fas fa-info-circle"></i> before the text area). Here below there are additional rules and standards that archivists/volunteers should comply with in order to ensure resulting data quality.</p>
		<p><strong>KEEPER</strong> Includes information on the current keeper of the archive described. This may correspond to the institution cataloguing the fond in ARTchives, or may be another institution.</p>
		<p>Fields in this section include the following:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Full Name</strong> The complete name of the institution responsible for the collection. If possible, select a term from Wikidata. This may or may not correspond with the physical repository of the collection (see <a href="#repository">Repository</a>). If a keeper has already been described in another record, a pop up will notice the user, who can skip the section.</li>
			<li><strong>Address</strong> The address of the responsible institution of the collection. Record street addresses in the form <code>[house number],[street name]</code> so as to make easier geolocalization.</li>
			<li><strong>City</strong> The city of the keeper. Select a city from the list of Wikidata terms so as to make easier geolocalization.</li>
			<li><strong>District</strong> The district of the keeper. Select a city from the list of Wikidata terms so as to make easier geolocalization. If difficult, try searching for "province of ..."</li>
			<li><strong>Country</strong> The country of the keeper. Select a city from the list of Wikidata terms so as to make easier geolocalization.</li>
			<li><strong>Phone</strong> The phone number, including prefix, of the keeper. Only digits (and eventually white spaces) must be typed here.</li>

			<li><strong>Website</strong> The website of the keeper. Include here the home page of the institution is available. It must start with the prefix <code>http://</code>.</li>
		</ul>
		<p><i class="fas fa-exclamation-circle"></i> <em>If an institution has already been recorded as a keeper of an archive in a prior record, and all the contact information were provided, there is no need to input the same information in a new record (check <a href="institutions">here</a> whether an institution has already been described in ARTchives). In such cases, only the name of the keeper is requested.</em></p>

When providing such a long description use a formal language, i.e. record appropriately proper names and avoid acronyms. When finished to type, press enter and wait few seconds. A number of tags will appear after the text area including topics extracted from the text and immediately reconciled to Wikidata. While you cannot add more tags here, you can remove the incorrect ones. Do not be disppointed if there are some mistakes, technology is not (yet) perfect! However, more tags can be added in the next section <em>SUBJECTS</em>. Please, discard obvious tags, such as <em>Art history</em> or the name of the art historian.</li>

		<p><strong>DATA ACCESS</strong> Data can be accessed by means of the  <a href="sparql">ARTchives SPARQL endpoint query interface</a> and API. Alternatively, <a href="https://query.wikidata.org">Wikidata</a> can be queried to retrieve ARTchives information.</p>
		
		<p><strong>SOURCE CODE</strong> The application source code is available in a <a href="https://github.com/marilenadaquino/artchives">gitHub repository</a>.</p>
		<p><strong>DATA MODEL</strong> ARTchives mainly reuses the Wikidata Model to facilitate the data export to Wikidata. Few new properties are added to characterise the nature of subjects of a collection (subproperties of <code>wdp:P921</code>), and to distinguish different types of archival notes (e.g. <code>art:hasNotesOnScopeAndContent</code>, <code>art:hasHistoricalNotes</code>).</p>
		<p>Data examples will be added soon.</p>
		<p><strong>URI DESIGN PATTERN</strong> When available, external URIs are reused directly, such as Wikidata, Open Library and Getty vocabularies IRIs. New entities created by cataloguers are in form <code>https://w3id.org/artchives/</code>+<code>[persistent ID]</code>.</p>
